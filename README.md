DataDecoy
=========

DataDecoy aims to break the all-or-nothing permission model of Android. It aims to dynamically allow the user to select the applications that are permitted to access his/her personal information.

Sadly, as much as we would've loved to keep this at the application level, to provide such powerful functionality, it is necessary to make changes to the Android source code.

However, the modifications are kept to a minimum.
